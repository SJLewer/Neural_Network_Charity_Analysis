# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
## Overview of Analysis:
More than 34,000 organizations have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. Using this historical data, create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

## Results:
 ### _Data Preprocessing_
 * What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for the model?
 * What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
 * What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?

 ### _Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model_
 * How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
 * Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
 * What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?

## Summary/Recommendation:
Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.
